How to resize images in .NET Core using C#

Since Microsoft has released System.Drawing.Common to provide access to GDI+ graphics functionality across cross-platform, 
i am using this to resize the images.

This is a simple example, how to resize the image to specified size and specified format. Implemented two methods in this; 

1. Resize image to specified size
2. Resize image to specified size by maintatining aspect ratio of image.

This .NET Core app runs in both Windows and Linux.
